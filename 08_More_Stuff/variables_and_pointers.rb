=begin
Variables are pointers to physical space in memory. In other words, variables are essentially labels we create to refer to some physical memory address in your computer.

=begin
From "Fiddling with Rubyâ€™s Fiddle":

"You can get the actual pointer value of an object by taking the object id, and doing a bitwise shift to the left. This will give you the pointer (or memory location) of the ruby object in memory."
=end

# Variables as pointers
# a = "hi there"
# a_memory_address = a.object_id << 1
# p "address for a = #{a_memory_address}"

# b = a
# # b_memory_address = b.object_id << 1
# # p "address for b = #{b_memory_address}"
# # # => "address for 'b' = 140285577861320"

# a << ", Anne"
# a_memory_address = a.object_id << 1
# p "address for a after new value assigned = #{a_memory_address}"
