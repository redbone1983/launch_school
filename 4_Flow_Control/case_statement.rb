# Write a method that takes a string as argument. The method should return a new, all-caps version of the string, only if the string is longer than 10 characters. Example: change "hello world" to "HELLO WORLD". (Hint: Ruby's String class has a few methods that would be helpful. Check the Ruby Docs!)

# def all_caps(str)
#   if str.length > 10
#     str.upcase!
#   else
#     "This string is not long enough!"
#   end
# end

# p all_caps("hello world")

# Exercise 3
# Write a program that takes a number from the user between 0 and 100 and reports back whether the number is between 0 and 50, 51 and 100, or above 100.

# print "Enter a number between 0 and 100. "
# number = gets.to_i


# if number < 0 
#   p "You can't enter a negative number."
# elsif number <= 50 
#   p "Your number is between 0 and 50"
# elsif number <= 100
#   p "Your number is between 51 and 100"
# else
#   p "Your number is greater than 100"
# end
