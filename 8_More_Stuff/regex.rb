Variables are pointers to physical space in memory. In other words, variables are essentially labels we create to refer to some physical memory address in your computer.

From "Fiddling with Rubyâ€™s Fiddle":

"You can get the actual pointer value of an object by taking the object id, and doing a bitwise shift to the left. This will give you the pointer (or memory location) of the ruby object in memory."

a_memory_address = a.object_id << 1
